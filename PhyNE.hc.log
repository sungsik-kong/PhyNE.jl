Starting topology modified to (5,(4,(3,(1,2))));
The search terminated at step 80 and at 75th consecutive failures.
Summary of each move:
Insertion of reticulation edge: 2 proposed, 1 accepted.
Tail move of reticulation edge: 25 proposed, 0 accepted. 
Head move of reticulation edge: 25 proposed, 0 accepted.
Change the direction of reticulation edge: 4 proposed, 0 accepted.
Deletion of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI): 24 proposed, 1 accepted.
On the current topology, 89 moves were made, including 14 unsuccessful moves.
Terminated because it reached the maximum number of failures (current nfail=75).
The best network found in this run: (5:10.143246111976964,(4:5.128207274589672,((3:1.7832993566222581,(2)#H6:::0.5947475713189532):1.3303497322531534,(1:1.1961994949262897,#H6:::0.40525242868104683):1.9174495939491218):2.01455818571426):5.0150388373872925);
