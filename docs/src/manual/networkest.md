# Network estimation
After parsing the input sequence alignment into quartet site pattern frequency data, we can estimate the network using a starting tree/network, that can be either randomly generated or estimated from the data. 
```@repl netest
startingtree = readTopology("(5,(4,(3,(2,1))));")
```
