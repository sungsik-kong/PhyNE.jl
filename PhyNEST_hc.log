(1/5) Searching for the best network using the hill climbing algorithm, 2023-12-17 17:13:27.547
The search terminated at step 120 and at 75th consecutive failures.
Summary of each move:
Insertion of reticulation edge: 3 proposed, 1 accepted.
Tail move of reticulation edge: 29 proposed, 1 accepted. 
Head move of reticulation edge: 33 proposed, 0 accepted.
Change the direction of reticulation edge: 10 proposed, 0 accepted.
Deletion of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI): 44 proposed, 3 accepted.
On the current topology, 96 moves were made, including 21 unsuccessful moves.
Terminated although it neither reached the maximum number of steps or failures,
possibly because there was no more move to make.
