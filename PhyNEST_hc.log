(1/15) Searching for the best network using the hill climbing algorithm...The search terminated at step 180 and at 100th consecutive failures.
Summary of each move:
Insertion of reticulation edge: 2 proposed, 2 accepted.
Tail move of reticulation edge: 56 proposed, 2 accepted. 
Head move of reticulation edge: 52 proposed, 0 accepted.
Change the direction of reticulation edge: 27 proposed, 1 accepted.
Deletion of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI): 43 proposed, 1 accepted.
On the current topology, 115 moves were made, including 15 unsuccessful moves.
Terminated because it reached the maximum number of failures (current maximum_number_of_failures=100).
