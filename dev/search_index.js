Extensions can be either .phy or .txt. For more information on PHYLIP, see here. After the PHYLIP file has been parsed, PhyNE creates a checkpoint file with the extension .ckp, which can be called later to prevent repetition of parsing the same data and save time. Moreover, the observed site pattern frequencies of every quartet from the alignment can be exported into a .csv file, for a user to explore for other purposes (e.g., manually computation of Patterson's D-statistic etc.). The following sections explain above procedures in detail.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/input/#Parsing-DNA-alignment-data","page":"Input","title":"Parsing DNA alignment data","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/input/","page":"Input","title":"Input","text":"A sample DNA alignment file called n5h1_5k.txt is given in the example folder of the package PhyNE (or can be downloaded here).
