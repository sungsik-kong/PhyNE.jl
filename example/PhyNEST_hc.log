Analysis start: 2023-05-15 at 14:36:54
Input sequence file: sample_n5h1.txt
Number of sequences: 5 
Sequence length: 1000000
Starting Topology: (5,(4,(3,(2,1))));
Outgroup specified for rooting: 5
Number of maximum reticulation(s): 1
The maximum number of iterations for each optimization: 1000
Search algorithm selected: Hill climbing
The maximum number of steps during search: 100000

(1/5) Searching for the best network using the hill climbing algorithm...The search terminated at step 94 and at 81th consecutive failures.
Summary of each move:
Insertion of reticulation edge: 2 proposed, 1 accepted.
Tail move of reticulation edge: 27 proposed, 0 accepted. 
Head move of reticulation edge: 29 proposed, 0 accepted.
Change the direction of reticulation edge: 5 proposed, 1 accepted.
Deletion of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI): 30 proposed, 1 accepted.
On the current topology, 96 moves were made, including 15 unsuccessful moves.
Terminated although it neither reached the maximum number of steps or failures,
possibly because there was no more move to make.
(1/5) Estimated topology in this run: (5:9.873014355923681,(4:4.978557302744444,((3:1.5703960202935816,(2:1.4303350626712767)#H6:1.5703960202935816::0.5246318237325145):1.4274316184507447,(1:1.4303350626712767,#H6:1.4303350626712767::0.4753681762674855):1.5674925760730496):1.9807296640001177):4.894457053179237);
