(1/1) Searching for the best network using the hill climbing algorithm, 2023-08-28 17:28:48.011
The search terminated at step 33 and at 23th consecutive failures.
Summary of each move:
Insertion of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Tail move of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted. 
Head move of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Change the direction of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Deletion of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI): 32 proposed, 1 accepted.
On the current topology, 25 moves were made, including 2 unsuccessful moves.
Terminated although it neither reached the maximum number of steps or failures,
possibly because there was no more move to make.
