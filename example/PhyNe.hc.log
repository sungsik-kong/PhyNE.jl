Input filename: n5h1_5k.txt
Number of sequences: 5 
Sequence length: 2500000
Starting Topology: (5,(4,((3,(2)#H6:::0.6),(1,#H6:::0.4))));
Outgroup specified for rooting: 1
Number of maximum reticulation(s): 1
The maximum number of iterations for each optimization: 1000
Search algorithm selected: Hill-climbing
The maximum number of steps during search: 50

Initiating 5 iterations...
(1/5) Searching for the best network using the hill-climbing algorithm...
Starting topology modified to (5,(4,((3,(2)#H6:::0.6),(1,#H6:::0.4))));
The search terminated at step 50 and at 50th consecutive failures.
Summary of each move:
Insertion of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Tail move of reticulation edge: 21 proposed, 0 accepted. 
Head move of reticulation edge: 16 proposed, 0 accepted.
Change the direction of reticulation edge: 4 proposed, 0 accepted.
Deletion of reticulation edge: 0 proposed, 0 accepted.
Nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI): 9 proposed, 0 accepted.
On the current topology, 58 moves were made, including 8 unsuccessful moves.
Terminated because it reached the maximum number of steps (current maxcount=50). 
It is recommended to increase the number of maxcount and rerun the analysis.
